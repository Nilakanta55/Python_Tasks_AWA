    "\n",
    "  You must create a simple program simulating a bank account withdrawal process. The program should:\n",

    "1) Ask the user for their account balance and the amount they want to withdraw.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Check for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).\n",

    "3) Handle cases such as trying to withdraw more money than available or trying to withdraw a negative amount.\n",

    "* Tasks to Handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Handle cases where the input is not a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Handle cases where the withdrawal amount is greater than the account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Handle cases where the withdrawal amount is negative.\n",

    "2. Checking for Negative or Excessive Withdrawal:\n",
    "* A condition checks if the withdrawal amount is less than zero. If so, it raises a ValueError.\n",
    "* A second condition checks if the withdrawal exceeds the balance, raising another ValueError if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exception Handling:\n",
    "* The try-except block catches any ValueError or unexpected errors, providing informative feedback without crashing the program.\n",
    "* General exceptions are caught with the except Exception as e block to ensure robustness."
